# HykSort

A Rusty implementation of HykSort from Sundar et. al [1] for ```Vec<T>``` arrays distributed using MPI.

The local sorts are not at all optimised, and this implementation uses Rust's ```.sort()``` method implemented via the ```Ord``` trait.


## Compile

Flags for taking advantage of fast math, and AVX2 on processors where available.

```bash
export RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+avx2,+fma"
cargo build --release
```

##Â Test

Run parallel tests.

```bash
cargo build && mpirun -n <nprocs> target/<debug/release>/parallel_tests
```

## Archer 2

Scaling experiments have been performed on Archer 2, with 6 billion integers on 64 ranks spread across 32 nodes being sorted in approximately 20 seconds.

Caveats for compiling on Archer2:

- Avoid OpenFFI, and use UCX instead for the networking layer. UCX is better optimised for sending large packets.
- Prefer the AMD AOCC compiler environment.
